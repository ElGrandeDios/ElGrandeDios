# Hi! I am Sid!! ðŸ˜Š

I'm currently learning Unreal Engine and participating
I am mainly looking to eventually and proggresively learn pro level C++(mostly C++), C# (pronounced C SHARP), Java, Swift and HTML, CSS and JS.
I also want to learn ethical hacking (WhiteHat).
I also use .NET  MAUI and other .NET products.

I've learnt 90% of the things I know using Stack Overflow, Bing Chat and ChatGPT.
I am a self-learner, who has been learning since the age of 8.

You can hire me anytime you want (Anytime after I am an adult).
